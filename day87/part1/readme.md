 Phone_Log Table has three columns namely Source_Phone_Nbr,  Destination_Phone_Nbr and Call_Start_DateTime. This table records all phone numbers that we dial in a given day.

Write a SQL to display the Source_Phone_Nbr and a flag where the flag needs to be set to ‘Y’ if first called number and last called number are the same and ‘N’ if first called number and last called number are different
