Players Table contains the group of each player in which they belong to. Match table contains details of the match played. The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the lowest player_id wins.
You can assume that, in each match, players belong to the same group.
Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.
